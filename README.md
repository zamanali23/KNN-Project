# KNN-Project

Skills Used: Python, Pandas, SKLearn, K Nearest Neighbours algorithm

Project Objective: Used the K Nearest Neighbours algorithm to classify a patientâ€™s condition as normal or abnormal based on various orthopedic parameters

Quantifiable Results: The accuracy of the KNN with K = 15 is 85.48% The accuracy of the NB is 82.26%

Compared predictive performance by fitting a Naive Bayes model to the data
Selected best model based on train and test performance
Tuned hyperparameter best score was 0.8586
The accuracy of the KNN with K = 15 is 85.48%
The accuracy of the NB is 82.26%
